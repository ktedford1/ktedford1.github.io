## About Me

I transitioned to data analysis after a career in scientific research, driven by my constant curiosity. I‚Äôm passionate about diving into datasets, examining them from all angles, finding hidden gems, and bringing them to light. 

My experience as a scientist specializing in immunology includes developing hypotheses, collecting data, and validating findings with statistics. To write science papers, I used visualizations and clear writing to highlight the relevance and interest of my results. In 2023, I pivoted to data analysis and expanded my skills to include Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, Rust, and more. I‚Äôm keen for more opportunities to analyze the ever-growing and fascinating pool of data that our world is generating.

### World Happiness Report
What determines our happiness in life? Is it internal? Or does it depend on conditions in the country we live in? This UN-sponsored Gallup international poll seeks to understand what determines happiness by asking just a few simple questions starting with ‚Äúhow happy are you?‚Äù. and covering freedom, political corruption, charitable giving, and social support. With this dataset, I asked, does national corruption control GDP per capita, and through that, control happiness?
