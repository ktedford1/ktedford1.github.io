## About Me

I transitioned to data analysis after a career in scientific research, driven by my constant curiosity. Iâ€™m passionate about diving into datasets, examining them from all angles, finding hidden gems, and bringing them to light. 

My experience as a scientist specializing in immunology includes developing hypotheses, collecting data, and validating findings with statistics. To write science papers, I used visualizations and clear writing to highlight the relevance and interest of my results. In 2023, I pivoted to data analysis and expanded my skills to include Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, Rust, and more. Iâ€™m keen for more opportunities to analyze the ever-growing and fascinating pool of data that our world is generating.
